# 1. Program to find the mean of numbers in a list
numbers = [2, 3, 4]
sum_list = sum(numbers)
mean_list = sum_list / len(numbers)
print("Mean of the list is:", mean_list)

else:
    median = unsorted_list[length // 2]
print("Median of the list is:", median)


# 3. Program to separate a list into even and odd numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
odd_nums = []
even_nums = []

        even_nums.append(number)
    else:
        odd_nums.append(number)

# 4. - Program to take a positive number as input from user. If the user enters negative number then keep promting him to enter positive number until he enters the positive number and then print the same
while Number <= 0:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a positive number.")
    Number = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))


7- consider the below list of list conatins following information :

a. The name of a university 
b. The total number of enrolled students
c. The annual tuition fees

universities = [
['California Institute of Technology', 2175, 37704],
['Harvard', 19627, 39849],
['Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 10566, 40732],
['Princeton', 7802, 37000],
['Rice', 5879, 35551],
['Stanford', 19535, 40569],
['Yale', 11701, 40500]
]

#a
university_names = []
for university in universities:
    university_names.append(university[0])
print("List of all universities:", university_names)


#b
total_students = 0
for university in universities:
    total_students += university[1]
print("Total number of students enrolled in all universities:", total_students)


#c 
tution_fee= []
for university in universities:
    tution_fee.append(university[2])
mean_tution_fee = round(sum(tution_fee)/len(tution_fee),2)
print("Mean Tution Fee is: ", mean_tution_fee)

8- write a program to convert above universities list to a dictionary. the keys should be the name of the university

9-  write a program that reverses a given string. For example, if the input is "Hello" from user, the output should be "olleH"

10- write a program that finds the largest number in a list(unsorted) of integers without using sort/sorted method.
