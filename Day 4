1- create a txt file and put 4-5 lines. Now create another file from the previous file and at the end of each line put the count of words.

example :
file 1:
this is namaste sql course
this is python course
this assinment is part of day4 lecture


file2:this is namaste sql course:5
this is python course:4
this assignment is part of day4 lecture:7

with open('file1.txt', 'w') as file1:
    lines = [
        "this is namaste sql course",
        "this is python course",
        "this assignment is part of day4 lecture"
    ]
    for line in lines:
        file1.write(line + '\n')

with open('file1.txt', 'r') as file1, open('file2.txt', 'w') as file2:
    for line in file1:
        line = line.strip()
        word_count = len(line.split())
        file2.write(line + ':' + str(word_count) + '\n')

print("File creation and word count operation completed!")

2- given below dictonaries of states and their capital:

capitals_dict = {
'Alabama': 'Montgomery',
'Alaska': 'Juneau',
'Arizona': 'Phoenix',
'Arkansas': 'Little Rock',
'California': 'Sacramento',
'Colorado': 'Denver',
'Connecticut': 'Hartford',
'Delaware': 'Dover',
'Florida': 'Tallahassee',
'Georgia': 'Atlanta',
}

pick a state from above dictonary and ask user to enter the capital of the state.If the user answers incorrectly, then repeatedly ask them
for the capital until they either enter the correct answer or type "exit".
If the user answers correctly, then display "Correct" and end the program. However, if the user exits without guessing correctly, display
the correct answer and the word "Goodbye".

Note: Make sure the user isn’t punished for case sensitivity. In other words, a guess of "Denver" is the same as "denver". Do the same for exiting—"EXIT" and "Exit" should work the same as "exit".
while True:
    if state in capitals_dict:
        capital = capitals_dict[state]
        guess = input("Enter the capital of {}: ".format(state))
        guess = guess.capitalize()  # Convert the guess to capitalize for case insensitivity

        if guess == capital:
            print("Correct!")
            break
        elif guess.lower() == 'exit':
            print("The correct answer was: {}".format(capital))
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Incorrect. Try again or type 'exit' to quit.")
    else:
        print("Invalid state. Please pick a state from the dictionary.")
    
    state = input("Pick a state from the dictionary: ")
    state = state.capitalize()


3- write a program to take state as input from user and print the capital of the state using above dictonary. If the state is not there in dictonary then print "sorry , information not available"
state = input("Enter a state: ")
capital = capitals_dict.get(state.capitalize())
if capital:
    print("The capital of {} is {}.".format(state, capital))
else:
    print("Sorry, information not available.")
